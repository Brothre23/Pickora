# Pickora üê∞

A small compiler that can convert Python scripts to pickle bytecode. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+

No third-party modules are required.

## Usage

```
usage: pickora.py [-h] [-d] [-r] [-o OUTPUT] file

A toy compiler that can convert Python scripts to pickle bytecode.

positional arguments:
  file                  the Python script to compile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --dis             disassamble compiled pickle bytecode
  -r, --eval, --run     run the pickle bytecode
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Write compiled pickle to file
```

For exmple, you can run:

```sh
python3 pickora.py -d samples/hello.py -o output.pkl
```

to compile `samples/hello.py` to `output.pkl` and show the disassamble result of the compiled pickle bytecode. 

But this won't run the pickle for you. If you want you should add `-r` option, or execute the following command after compile:

```sh
python3 -m pickle output.pkl
```

## Todos

- [x] Operators (<s>compare</s>, <s>unary</s>, <s>binary</s>, <s>subscript</s>)
- [ ] Unpacking assignment
- [ ] Augmented assignment
- [ ] Macros (directly using GLOBAL, OBJECT bytecodes)
- [ ] lambda / function (optional)

### Impracticable 
- [ ] Function call with kwargs
  - `NEWOBJ_EX` only support type object (it calls `__new__`)

## FAQ

### What is pickle?

[RTFM](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).

### Why?

It's cool.

### Is it useful?

No, not at all, it's definitely useless.

### So, is this a garbage?

Yep, a cool garbage.

### Would you support syntaxes like `if` / `while` / `for` ?

No.
Because all pickle can do is just simply define a variable or call a function, so this kind of syntax wouldn't exist.

But if you want to do things like:
```python
ans = input("Yes/No: ")
if ans == 'Yes':
  print("Great!")
elif ans == 'No':
  exit()
```
It's still achievable! You can rewrite your code to this:

```python
from functools import partial
condition = {'Yes': partial(print, 'Great!'), 'No': exit}
ans = input("Yes/No: ")
condition.get(ans, repr)()
```
ta-da!

For the loop syntax, you can try to use `map` / `reduce` ... .

And yes, you are right, it's functional programming time!
