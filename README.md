# Pickora üê∞

A small compiler that can convert Python scripts to pickle bytecode. 

## Usage

```
usage: pickora.py [-h] [-d] [-r] [-o OUTPUT] file

positional arguments:
  file                  the Python script to compile

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --dis             disassamble the pickle output
  -r, --eval            run the pickle bytecode
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Write output pickle to file
```

For exmple, you can run:

```sh
python pickora.py -d samples/hello.py -o output.pkl
```

to compile `samples/hello.py` and show the disassamble result of the compiled pickle bytecode. 

But it won't run the pickle for you. If you want you should add `-r` option, or run the following command after compile:

```sh
python -m pickle output.pkl
```
